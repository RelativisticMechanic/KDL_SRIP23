# FORM-UPLOAD.PHP

## Function

This is the page that contains the form to upload a file or a batch of files to the Druid cluster. Although the name is misleading as it is largely HTML with no PHP code in it. 

The form sends a POST request to either `upload.php` or `upload-batch.php` depending upon whether the user chooses to upload a single file or multiple files.

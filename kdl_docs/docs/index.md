## Introduction

The Karnataka Data Lake is an ongoing project that aims to unify data from various departments of the Karnataka government into a single cluster than can be queryed through various methods and used by researchers and government officials to implement policy decisions.

This documentation is for the backend part of the workflow that is currently a set of scripts and utilties that make it easier to ingest, query and analyse data that is stored on the server and was created over the course of two months during the Summer Research Internship at IIIT Bangalore.
